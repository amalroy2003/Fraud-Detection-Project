# Fraud Detection Project (Banking Domain)

This project focuses on detecting fraudulent ATM transactions using machine learning techniques. The dataset and models are part of a broader analysis aimed at improving financial security in the banking domain.

## 📁 Project Structure

- **Notebook**: `Banking Domain(ATM Fraud detection).ipynb` – the main analysis and modeling
- **CSV Files**: Various input datasets (e.g., `train.csv`, `test_share.csv`)
- **Presentations**: Project summaries and business insights in `.pptx` format
- **PDF**: Algorithm documentation (e.g., Isolation Forest)

## 🚀 Objectives

- Understand patterns of ATM fraud
- Build and evaluate anomaly detection models (e.g., Isolation Forest)
- Analyze features and outlier behavior
- Score transactions and visualize fraud likelihood

## 📊 Tools & Technologies

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Isolation Forest
- Matplotlib / Seaborn

## ⚠️ Note on Large Files

The dataset includes files like `train.csv` (>88 MB). If you plan to clone or fork this repo, consider setting up [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com/) for large file support.

## 📌 Future Improvements

- Implement ensemble models for better accuracy
- Real-time fraud detection simulation
- Interactive dashboard for results
